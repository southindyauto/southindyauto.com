<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>South Indy Auto values your privacy, but unfortunately that doesn&#8217;t mean that all of the third-party advertising networks, data brokers, networks of affiliate sites, parent companies, subsidiaries, and other entities that we do business with value it (although they all claim to as far as we know). So here&#8217;s a little more detail in case you care to read it:</p>

<h2>Website Visitors</h2>

<p>Like most website operators, South Indy Auto may collect non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. The purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how our visitors use this website. South Indy Auto may also collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.</p>

<h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>

<p>South Indy Auto discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its service providers, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on South Indy Auto&#8217;s behalf or to provide services available at South Indy Auto&#8217;s website.</p>

<p>Some of those service providers, contractors, and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using South Indy Auto&#8217;s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. South Indy Auto will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its service providers, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, South Indy Auto discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when South Indy Auto believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of South Indy Auto, third parties or the public at large. If you send a request (for example via a support email or via another feedback mechanism), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help clarify or respond to your request or to help support other users. </p>

<p>South Indy Auto is a small business and its owner has limited resources. While we try to take reasonable measures to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information, we don&#8217;t have the time, money, nor other resources to take all possible measures to protect your information. If you don&#8217;t want your information to be compromised through this site, don&#8217;t provide it and/or don&#8217;t use/visit this website.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>This website or any related third party sites may leave behind a little gift known as a cookie&mdash;a string of information filled with inscrutable gibberish that allows various computers around the globe to identify you, including your preferences, browser settings, which parts of the site you visited, which ads you clicked on, and whether you actually purchased something.</p>

<p>Those same cookies may let our advertising and data broker partners track you across every other site you visit, then dump all of your information into a huge database attached to a unique ID number, which they may sell ad infinitum without ever notifying you or asking for permission.</p>

<p>South Indy Auto visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using this website, with the drawback that certain features of this website may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

<h2>Business Transfers</h2>

<p>If South Indy Auto, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that South Indy Auto goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of South Indy Auto may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

<h2>Data Retention</h2>

<p>Your information may be stored for an indefinite amount of time. And when we do eventually get around to deleting it, you can bet it&#8217;s still kicking around on some network backup drives in somebody&#8217;s closet. There&#8217;s nothing we can do about that unless you want to pay us a ridiculous sum of money to maintain and secure our own server to host this website. And even then, we&#8217;ll still probably outsource it.</p>

<h2>Ads</h2>

<p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by South Indy Auto and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

<h2>Don&#8217;t like this privacy policy?</h2>

<p>Hey, Did somebody hold a gun to your head and force you to visit this site? No, they did not. Did you run into a pay wall on the home page demanding your credit card number? No, you did not. We&#8217;re just being honest, whereas many others sugarcoat the truth but do this same stuff as well. In our case, it&#8217;s mostly only because we embed Google Maps in the main page. We cannot control what Google does with your information (nor does this policy apply to their use of your information).</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy may change at any time. If you want to know about changes, it&#8217;s your responsibility to frequently check this page for any changes to it. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change. We&#8217;re actually impressed that you&#8217;re still reading this.</p>
